Types of Linear Models in Machine Learning
There are several types of linear models used in machine learning and statistics:

Linear Regression:

Purpose: Used for predicting continuous outcomes (e.g., predicting house prices, salaries).
Description: Models the relationship between one or more input variables (features) and a continuous output variable (target) as a straight line.

b: Bias term (y-intercept).
Example: Predicting the price of a house based on its size, location, and number of rooms.
Linear Classification (Logistic Regression):

Purpose: Used for binary classification problems (e.g., spam vs. not spam).
Description: Models the probability of an event occurring by fitting a linear equation to the data and then using a logistic function to convert this linear combination into a probability.

Example: Determining if an email is spam (1) or not spam (0) based on word frequencies in the email.
Linear Support Vector Machines (Linear SVM):

Purpose: Used for classification tasks.
Description: Finds the best line (hyperplane) that separates different classes of data points with the maximum margin.
Equation: It involves a linear decision boundary to separate classes in the feature space.
Example: Classifying emails into categories such as "work," "personal," and "spam" based on text features.
Linear Neural Network (Perceptron):

Purpose: Basic building block for neural networks.
Description: Computes a weighted sum of the inputs and applies a threshold to decide the output.
Equation:
𝑦

Example: Early image recognition tasks like distinguishing between simple shapes.
Why Linear Models?
Linear models are simple, easy to interpret, and often provide a good baseline for many machine learning problems. They work well when there is a linear relationship between the features and the target. However, when relationships in the data are more complex (non-linear), more advanced models like decision trees, neural networks, or ensemble methods might be needed.
